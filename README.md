From the elbow curve above, it can be determined that the optimal number of clusters is 4 (k=4). Elbow Curve allowed us to identify clusters with diminishing return.

###Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results:

This 3-D scatter plot was obtained using the PCA algorithm to reduce the crytocurrencies dimensions to three principal components.
