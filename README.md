The purpose of this project is to create an cryptocurrency analysis/report forMartha's clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

## Results
Following the preprocessing and cleaning phase we have a total of 532 tradable cryptocurrencies.

From the elbow curve above, it can be determined that the optimal number of clusters is 4 (k=4). Elbow Curve allowed us to identify clusters with diminishing return.

**Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results:**

This 3-D scatter plot was obtained using the PCA algorithm to reduce the crytocurrencies dimensions to three principal components.

## Summary
We have demonstrated the classification of 532 cryptocurrencies based on similarities of their features.
Particularities of each group need to be analyzed to determine their performance and potential interest for Martha's clients.
